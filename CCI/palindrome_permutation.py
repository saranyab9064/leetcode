"""
Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of
a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A
permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just
dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat'; "atc o etaÂ·; etc.)
